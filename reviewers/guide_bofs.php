<h1>Guidelines for Reviewers of BOF Submissions</h1>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>General Remarks</h2>
</div></div>   
     
<p>Our goal in choosing Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions is to provide a
selection of discussion sessions that will be attractive to attendees.
With this in mind, answers to the following questions are most useful
in BOF reviews:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Is the topic relevant to the symposium?</li>
   <li> Do you expect that the level of interest in the BOF would be high?</li>
   <li> Is the proposal suitable for a BOF (recall that BOFs are meant for
     open-ended discussion, and are explicitly not meant for either
     presentations or product demos)</li>
   <li> Are the particular presenters appropriate?  (Remember that BOF 
     reviewing is not blind.)</li>
   <li> How could the authors improve the quality of the BOF, if it is 
     accepted?</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously this list is not exhaustive. The Program Committee and
authors will appreciate your views on other issues as well.</p>
