<h2><a name="general">General Recommendations</a></h2>
</div></div>  
            <p>
            Here are some recommendations for writing reviews of submitted
            papers
            that help the authors and improve the quality of the symposium. 
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Recognize the difference in types of papers. 
                   This year we have asked authors to categorize their
                   papers to help you distinguish their aim.  

                   <ul>
                     <li> <strong>Experience reports</strong> describe
                          an idea or a course that worked well and
                          is now being recommended to others. 
                          </li>

                     <li> <strong>Research studies</strong> present
                          a more careful study, which is particularly
                          differentiated by its use of appropriate
                          methodology.  Please note the methodology
                          does not need to be quantitative; rather, it needs
                          to be appropriate to support the claims
                          made by the author.
                          </li>

                     <li> <strong>Philosophical papers</strong> present
                          an argument for some idea about our curriculum,
                          course or field.  
                          </li>

                     <li> <strong>Tool papers</strong> may describe
                          courseware or a technique that the author
                          believes has wide application.
                          </li>
                   </ul>

                   <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                   While each type of paper is evaluated on organization,
                   technical soundness, potential contribution and overall
                   evaluation, you may be looking for different things
                   in these categories depending on the category of the paper.
                   You do not need to require an experience report
                   to be a research study, nor a research study to provide
                   a tool.  All papers should show appropriate organization
                   and should reflect the literature that already exists
                   related to the topic being discussed.  All claims should
                   be supported by logical arguments that follow from ideas,
                   experience or data provided. 
                   </p>
                   </li>

              <li> Your job as a reviewer is to write detailed reviews,
                   even for excellent papers.  Tell the authors why you
                   liked their paper, so that the authors know what made
                   them so successful.  
                   </li>

              <li> Even if your opinion is that the paper is poorly written
                   or poorly thought-out, you can still provide constructive
                   criticisms to help the authors, and in the long run,
                   the conference.  Think of your goal as convincing
                   the authors of the paper you're reviewing to submit
                   something else next year, but of such high quality
                   that it will be well-reviewed and easily accepted.
                   Give the authors advice on how to do that.
                   </li>

              <li> The best reviews clearly justify the reviewer's choice
                   of rating.  The least valuable review gives a low score
                   with no written comments.  That simply tells the authors
                   that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication
                   of how or why.
                   </li>

              <li> The focus of your review should be on content.  
                   </li>
                   
              <li>Papers that you receive are supposed to be anonymous. Your review
should be based on the merits of the paper, not the reputation of the
authors or their institutions. Therefore, we have asked the authors to
remove all identifiable references to themselves.  We realize that reviewers sometimes know the
work and can guess who the authors of the papers might be.</li>

<li>If you recognize the work, it is your responsibility to give a fair
and unbiased review, using only the information in the paper.
If you do not feel that you can give a fair, unbiased review based
on the paper and not the authors or institutions, please contact the program
chairs immediately.</li>

<li>Your review should not include comments to the authors about the
anonymization (or lack thereof) in the paper.  If you feel that it is
necessary to comment on this, please use the text box, 'Confidential
comments to the committee.'</li>

<li>We realize that occasionally anonymization requires the authors to
remove information that affects your review (information that otherwise
the paper appears to lack). As a reviewer, you can give the authors the
benefit of the doubt. Use the 'Confidential comments to the committee'
box to indicate this to us. Example "This paper should reference Mark
Guzdial's work, unless those references were removed
for anonymity").     </li>

              <li> Please point out typographic and grammatical errors,
                   unless there are too many of them. 
                   </li>

              <li> Although SIGCSE requires all submitted papers
                   to be polished work, all accepted authors get a brief
                   opportunity to improve the presentation of their paper
                   before camera-ready copy is due.  Your detailed feedback
                   may help improve a paper, and in a small way,
                   improve the conference. 
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            SIGCSE 2011 will use a
            <a href="metareviews.php">meta-review process</a>
            after reviews
            have been turned in.  Reviews that do not objectively,
            accurately, and clearly assess a paper's suitability
            for publication at SIGCSE, founded in the reviewer's
            disciplinary expertise and on the basis of the written paper's
            originality, technical soundness, contribution to CS education,
            and clarity of presentation may be deleted.
            </p>

            <p>
            For example, an unacceptable review might:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> be incoherent, unreadable, or irrelevant to the paper;
                   </li>
              <li> focus on the paper's topic area or presumed authors
                   at the expense of assessment of the paper itself; or
                   </li>
              <li> provide no justification for its numeric ratings.
                   (Even in &quot;obvious&quot; cases, reviewers should
                   briefly justify ratings.)
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Please note that a difference in rating or opinion with other
            reviewers or PC members will NEVER be cause for deletion of a
            review.

<h2><a name="examples">Examples of Good Reviews</a></h2>
</div></div> 

            <p>
            To help reviewers better understand the qualities of
            good, useful reviews, here are several example comments,
            organized by review category:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> <strong>The paper presentation (organization and writing style)</strong>

                   <ul>
                     <li> <em>The organization of the units on forensics
                          was well done.  However, the discussion of how
                          it fits into the curriculum is overly broad
                          and not too realistic.  Many factors were
                          overlooked on the "curriculum side".</em>
                          </li>

                     <li> <em>Good level of detail on your approach.
                          Table 2 is very handy.  Under Section 2, it seems
                          like log analysis and auditing may fit in your
                          column two.   How will you ensure additional
                          security emphasis is implemented?</em>
                          </li>

                     <li> <em> The paper was easy to read, although it
                          could benefit from a review of the English
                          sentence structure.  The paper was organized
                          in an easy-to-follow manner.  The authors
                          explained their motivations and methods
                          for their study.</em>
                          </li>

                     <li> <em> The paper could use additional proofing
                          and polishing.  I suggest finding a non-robotics
                          person to read for both language and communication.
                          Some sentences are poorly formed (e.g., sent. 1
                          of last par. in sec. 1).  Some content seems
                          misplaced (e.g., discussion of mobility
                          in section 3).</em>
                          </li>

                     <li> <em> The organization is faultless. It is very
                          clear what the paper is going to say and how.
                          The paper follows through with crystal clear
                          subject headings and a logical flow of information.
                          There are some grammatical problems; these are not
                          serious, but a thorough proof-reading
                          would be helpful.</em>

              <li> <strong>The idea or work presented is original and
                   appropriately builds on and acknowledges previous work
                   in the area</strong>

                   <ul>
                     <li> <em> I would have liked to see some discussion

                          that have examined exactly the phenomenon this
                          paper does, a short search in the ACM digital
                          library turned up these examples that are

                          that we rarely see at SIGCSE.
