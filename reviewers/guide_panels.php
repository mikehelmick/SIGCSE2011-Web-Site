<h1>Guidelines for Reviewers of Panels</h1>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>General Remarks</h2>
</div></div>   
            <p>
            Your job as a reviewer of Panels is an important one.
            Through your reviews you have the opportunity to help
            the authors and to improve the quality of the symposium.
            Below are some general guidelines for writing good Panel reviews:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Your job is to write detailed reviews, even for
                   excellent proposals.  Tell the authors why you liked
                   their proposal, so that they know what made it successful.
                   </li>

              <li> If you believe that the proposal is poorly written
                   or poorly thought-out, provide constructive criticism
                   to help the authors.
                   </li>

              <li> The best reviews clearly justify the reviewer's choice
                   of rating.  The least valuable review gives a low score
                   with no written comments.  This simply tells the
                   authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no
                   indication of how or why.  It is of no help to the
                   members of the Program Committee, who are charged with
                   making program decisions based on your reviews.
                   </li>

              <li> Although SIGCSE requires all Panel proposals to be
                   polished work, the authors will have a brief opportunity
                   to improve their proposals before camera-ready copy
                   is due.  Your detailed feedback may help improve
                   a panel and, as a result, the conference.
                   </li>
                   
              <li><b>DISTINCTION BETWEEN PANELS AND SPECIAL SESSIONS:</b>
Panels present multiple perspectives on a specific topic. Special sessions
are an opportunity to customize and experiment with the SIGCSE conference
format (e.g. a seminar on a new topic, a committee report, or a forum on
curriculum issues) </li>     
            </ul>

<h2>More Detailed Suggestions</h2>
</div></div>  
            <p>
            The questions on the Panel review form are quite general.
            The benefit of such a review form is that it allows you
            to write a wide range of comments that are appropriately
            tailored to the specific proposal.
            </p>

            <p>
            At the same time, many reviewers appreciate specific
            suggestions of issues to consider as they read proposals
            and write reviews.  Where appropriate, please
            try to address the following in your review:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Is the panel topic suitable for the symposium?
                   </li>

              <li> Do you expect that the level of interest in the panel
                   would be high?
                   </li>

              <li> Are the particular presenters appropriate?  Does their
                   expertise match the panel topic?
                   (Remember that Panel reviewing is not blind.)
                   </li>

              <li> Does the proposal appropriately place the topic
                   in the larger context of Computer Science education?
                   Are the authors aware of a range of ideas on the topic?
                   If appropriate, do the authors cite related work?
                   (In evaluating this, please keep in mind that proposals
                   are limited to two pages, so it is unreasonable
                   to expect a detailed &quot;Related Work&quot; section or
                   a long bibliography.)
                   </li>

              <li> Is the structure of the panel presentation reasonable?

                   <ul>
                     <li> Is the topic a good one for a panel?  Is there
                          some other format that would be more appropriate
                          (e.g., a special session, workshop or paper)?
                          </li>

                     <li> Will the speakers represent multiple views and offer
                          distinct ideas?  
                          </li>

                     <li> Will the speakers be able to present their views
                          in the time allotted (75 minutes total),
                          while leaving time for questions or
                          audience participation (30 minutes suggested)?
                          </li>

                     <li> A typical panel consists of 4 participants
                          including the moderator.  If there are
                          more than 4, have they convinced you that
                          everyone will be able to speak and that time
                          will still be available for audience participation?
                          </li>
                   </ul>
                   </li>

              <li> Is the proposal well-written?  Is it clear and
                   well-organized?  Are there any technical errors?
                   </li>

              <li> Do you have any suggestions for the authors ...

                   <ul>
                     <li> ... to improve the proposal itself (either for
                          publication in the proceedings or for submission
                          to a future symposium)?
                          </li>

                     <li> ... to improve the quality of the presentation,
                          if accepted?
                          </li>
                   </ul>
                   </li>
            </ul>


            <p>
            Obviously this list is not exhaustive.  The Program Committee
            and authors will appreciate your views on other issues as well.
            </p>
