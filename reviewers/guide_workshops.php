<h1>Guidelines for Reviewers of Workshop Submissions</h1>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>General Remarks</h2>
</div></div>   
            <p>
            Our goal in choosing workshops is to provide a selection of
            workshops that will be attractive to attendees, well-organized,
            and effectively presented.  Of course, it is also important
            that the presenters have appropriate expertise in the area
            of the workshop.   With this in mind, answers to the following
            questions are most useful in workshop reviews:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Is this of broad interest to the community
                   (i.e., will this get an audience)?
                   </li>

              <li> Is this of narrow interest to the community
                   (i.e., is it reasonably authoritative to experts
                   in the specific area)?
                   </li>

              <li> Is the proposal realistic given time, space, and
                   resource constraints and the likely background
                   of audience members?
                   </li>

              <li> Is this likely to serve audiences well/will they come
                   away satisfied?
                   </li>

              <li> How novel/exciting is this?
                   </li>

              <li> How can the abstract do a better job of communicating
                   the target audience, content, and excitement
                   of the workshop?
                   </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
            Please include constructive criticism, even for a workshop
            proposal that you do not think should be included in the
            conference.  We hope the proposers will take your comments
            to heart and write better proposals for future workshops.
            Successful proposers have a chance to revise their abstract,
            and also, of course to plan their workshop with your
            suggestions in mind.
            </p>

            <p>
            As with papers, the best reviews clearly justify the reviewer's
            choice of rating.
            </p>

                          There is a lot of interest in trying to teach
                          YYY within the traditional CS program.
                          This workshop has the potential to give attendees
                          a good rubric for doing this as well as providing
                          an infrastructure for implementing it.

                          This Workshop Proposal addresses CS teacher
                          education. It is therefore a main concern in SIGCSE,
                          is fairly well described and the team shows
                          experience on the subject.

                          ZZZ is important in many areas and has become a
                          very common way to present information.
                          Making the topic available to this audience,
                          I believe, is very appropriate.

                          This is a well-formulated workshop proposal on a
                          topic that is very likely to be appealing to most
                          software engineering or CS capstone instructors.
                          It is likely to have a significant level of
                          participation and participants will most likely
                          leave with a new set of tools for teaching SE.

                          The topic is very narrow, covering use of a
                          specific tool for a minor, optional part
                          of a graphics course.

                          ZZZ workshops have been well attended in the past;
                          there's every reason to think there are plenty
                          more educators who would benefit from hands-on
                          practice (and who would be pretty disappointed
                          if there were no ZZZ workshop at SIGCSE).

                          The presenters are obviously well qualified.
                          However, this topic has been around for a while now.
                          My overall sense is that for SIGCSE participants
                          there are now many suitable, alternate sources
                          of the knowledge, skills, and resources that
                          would be presented through this workshop,
                          including the presenters' textbooks and
                          online resources and guidance.

                          must keep up to date, and often do not have the
                          time to do it. This workshop seems to be a good
                          place for it.

                          are not clearly defined.  What will the workshop
                          participant know at the end of the workshop?
                          How might a participant use the skills learned
                          in the workshop in their own teaching and/or research?

                          of contents; specifically a systematic table
                          of the methods planned to be included in the workshop.

                          has been tried out. The presenter is the developer
                          of the materials and has experience with similar
                          workshops, so he is well qualified.  I like that
                          the goal of the workshop is to get participants
                          to the point where they can design their own labs
                          on this material, rather than just present existing
                          exercises (though those are very valuable!).

                          attendees.  It is also good that the presenters
                          have a contingency plan in case equipment issues
                          arise. This proposal is very well thought out.

                          There is no syllabus, no detail about methods
                          or software.  The take home materials are scant
                          for a software development workshop; I would think
                          a CD with materials on it would be more appropriate
                          than a "detailed handout".

                          They clearly state what the goals of the workshop
                          are and give a taste of the type of strategies
                          that will be discussed in the workshop.
                          Attendees will receive high quality materials
                          they can take back to their institutions to help
                          convey the message of the workshop and seek
                          backing for their plans from administration.
                          The fact that the workshop organizers can provide
                          research basis for the suggested strategies
                          is very appealing.

                          to point out the success of this approach over
                          (1) standard lecture and/or (2) work of others?

                          This is probably a worry to instructors who are
                          considering a drastic change to their teaching style.

                          some experience will also attend.  The presenters
                          may need to be prepared for different levels of
                          experience and interest.
