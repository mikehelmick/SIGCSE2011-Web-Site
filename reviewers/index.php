 <p>
            Submissions are reviewed according to categories indicated
            by the authors.  Reviewers will be assigned no more than three papers or six submissions of another type, based on their indicated subject areas of expertise.
            At least four reviewers are assigned to each.  Papers are only
            available in electronic PDF format.  Reviewers must use a Web
            browser and software capable of displaying PDF documents (For example: <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO" target="_blank">Adobe Reader</a>).  
            <i>Reviewers of videos must have a Web browser with the Adobe Flash plugin, capable of
            viewing videos published on YouTube</i> (<a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube.com</a>). 
            </p>
            
            <p>The reviewing process has 3 simple steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li> When reviews are assigned, you will be sent the reference numbers for each submission you are reviewing along with a reminder of your reviewer ID and password. <!-- Become familiar
                   with the review criteria by looking at 
                   <a href="http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2011/Reviewers/selectReviewForm.asp">Proposal Review Forms</a> for each category of submission. --> </li>

              <li> Read through the collections of example review text for
                   the types of submissions you are reviewing. 
                   Included are examples of comments for good, useful reviews.

            <p>
            <em>Note</em>:  All reviews will be distributed anonymously
            to both the author(s) and reviewers of that submission.
            This will give the author feedback and provide information
            to reviewers as well.  It is hoped that, over time,
            this feedback will help make the review process
            more consistent as reviewers can compare their responses
            to those of others.
