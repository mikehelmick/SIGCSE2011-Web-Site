<h1>The Meta-Review Process for Paper Submissions</h1>

            <p>
            SIGCSE has been progressively improving our reviewing process
            in response to community requests, e.g., [1,2,3].
            At the same time, the number of submissions to SIGCSE has risen
            over time.  (Last year, there were 2 Program Chairs,
            324 paper submissions, and over 1500 reviews.)
            </p>

            <p>
            To continue the process of improvement, to provide authors
            with more information on how the Program Chairs use reviews
            to analyze the paper and how authors can use reviews
            constructively in case of resubmission, and to mitigate the
            increasing burden on the Program Committee chairs,
            we have established a prototype paper reviewing process
            for SIGCSE 2009.  This page explains how the new process
            affects each of the constituencies.
            </p>


<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Authors</h2>
</div></div>   
            <p>
            <!--
            Authors submit papers for double-blind review.
            The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible,
            allow the author(s) of the paper an unbiased review.
            The authors choose the level of anonymity in the paper.
            At the lowest level, they may choose to use no anonymization;
            at the highest level, they may remove <strong>all</strong>
            references to the authors (including author's names and
            affiliation plus identifying information within the body
            of the paper such as websites or related publications). -->
            After reviewing is complete, authors will see their reviews
            as in previous years.
            </p>
 
            <p>Authors will also receive meta-reviews that synthesize the
            existing reviews, clarifying how the program committee
            interprets the disparate information from individual reviews.
            </p>


<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Reviewers</h2>
</div></div>
            <p>
            At least four reviewers review each paper.
            Reviewers are drawn from the SIGCSE reviewer pool
            with preference for those whose expertise match the
            paper's topic areas.
            </p>

            <p>
            A review must objectively, accurately, and clearly assess
            a paper's suitability for publication at SIGCSE,
            founded in the reviewer's disciplinary expertise
            and on the basis of the written paper's originality,
            technical soundness, contribution to computer science
            education, and clarity of presentation.
            </p>

            <p>Reviews that do not meet this standard may be deleted.
            For example, an unacceptable review might:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> be incoherent, unreadable, or irrelevant to the paper;
                   </li>

              <li> focus on the paper's topic area or presumed authors
                   at the expense of assessment of the paper itself; or
                   </li>

              <li> provide no justification for its numeric ratings.
                   (Even in &quot;obvious&quot; cases, reviewers should
                   briefly justify ratings.)
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Reviewers whose reviews are consistently unacceptable
            may be permanently disbarred from SIGCSE reviewing.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: A difference in rating or opinion with other reviewers
            or with Program Committee members will <strong>never</strong>
            be cause for deletion of a review.
            </p>

<h2>Associate Program Chairs</h2>
</div></div>
            <p>One of the six Associate Program Chairs will synthesize
            each paper's reviews into a &quot;meta-review&quot;
            to improve accuracy, quality, and effectiveness
            of the selection process.
            </p>

            <p>
            Associate Program Chairs were selected by the Program Chairs
            for their disciplinary expertise.  Associate Program Chairs
            read the papers' reviews and abstracts though not,
            in most cases, the paper itself.
            </p>

            <p>
            Associate Program Chairs will:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li> Delete, in the rare cases described above,
                   unacceptable reviews.  
                   </li>

              <li> Usually, summarize the case for and against accepting
                   a paper based on its abstract, reviews, and possibly
                   its contents.

                   <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                   Sometimes, summarize only the case for accepting
                   if reviewers' ratings are consistently high,
                   or analogously, only the case against accepting when
                   ratings are consistently low.
                   </p>

                   <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                   In rare cases (e.g., when the reviews are deemed
                   irreconcilably disparate or when too few reviewers
                   claim familiarity with the area), read the paper fully
                   and provide a &quot;normal&quot; review, in addition
                   to the meta-review.
                   </p>
                   </li>

              <li> Rate the paper on the basis of existing reviews.
                   Associate Program Chairs are charged with making strong
                   recommendations; thus, their ratings will often be 1s
                   or 6s.  They will briefly justify the rating in the
                   meta-review.
                   </li>
            </ol>

<h2>Program Chairs</h2>
</div></div>

            <p>
            The Program Chairs' duty, quoted from
            <a href="http://sigcse.org/conferences/ProgramChair.shtml">SIGCSE's Program Chair Responsibility Policy</a>,
            is &quot;to create a good, well balanced program at the SIGCSE
            Technical Symposium and the ITiCSE conference.  The program
            should provide both short and long term benefits
            to the conference attendees and the wider community.&quot;
            </p>

            <p>
            Within the framework described here, that means ensuring
            overall quality in the reviewing process and assembling
            an excellent program that reflects reviewers' and
            Associate Program Chairs' decisions with respect to
            the overall composition, exigencies, and special focus
            of the conference.
            </p>

            <p>
            Program Chairs make all final decisions on accepting or
            rejecting papers on the basis of the papers, their reviews,
            their meta-reviews,
            and a global effort to compose an excellent program.
            </p>

            <p>
            A Program Chair will read every meta-review of every
            submitted paper.  In many cases, Program Chairs will also
            consult abstracts, reviews, or the papers themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
            Finally, the Program Chairs will report to the community
            --- in the proceedings or at the business meeting --- 
            on the aggregate outcome of the process and its
            potential for revision or extension in coming years.
            </p>
