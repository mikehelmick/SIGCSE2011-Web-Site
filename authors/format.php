<li><b>Columns:</b> Text should be presented in two columns each 3.33 inches wide. There should be a 0.33 inch space between the columns. The two columns on the last page should be the same length approximately.</li>
<li><b>Section heads:</b> Section heads are flush left, Times Roman, bold, 12 point, ALL CAPITALS, and numbered starting at 1. There should be an additional 6 points of white space above the section head.</li>
<li><b>Subsection heads:</b> If your paper has subsections, they are flush left, Times Roman, bold, 12 point, and subnumbered (for example, 1.1). Initial letters of the subsection heading should be capitalized. There should be an additional 6 points of white space above the subsection head unless it immediately follows a section head. (Please see the templates for examples.)</li>
<li><b>Subsubsections:</b> If your paper has subsubsections, they are flush left, Times Roman, italics, 11 point, with initial letters capitalized, and subnumbered (for example, 1.1.2 or 1.2.3.4).
