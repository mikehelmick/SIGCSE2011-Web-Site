            <p>
            Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) documents are a
            standardized and convenient method to exchange data files without
            affecting the original appearance. SIGCSE will accept electronic
            submissions of papers only in this format.

            <p>
            You have a number of options for converting your Word,
            WordPerfect, or Postscript files into Adobe PDF.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Your version of Microsoft Word may allow you to save
                   as a PDF document. Other word processing software may have
                   similar features.
                   </li>

              <li> <a href="http://www.primopdf.com">PrimoPDF</a>
                   is a free program that installs like a printer and
                   saves your file as a PDF document.
                   </li>

              <li> If you already have Adobe Acrobat installed on your
                   computer refer to your software documentation for
                   instructions on choosing PDF Writer as your printer.
                   Instead of printing your document, the software will
                   create a PDF file.
                   </li>

              <li> Export the Word document from within OpenOffice, available at
                   <a href="http://openoffice.org">openoffice.org</a>.
                   </li>

              <li> Adobe has an online service to convert your Word,
                   WordPerfect and other formatted documents
                   into Adobe PDF format (
                   <a href="http://cpdf.adobe.com/">Create Adobe PDF Online</a>
                   ). The converted file is either sent to you
                   via e-mail or available through FTP.  You may register
                   for a trial membership of the Adobe Online service and
                   convert five files at no charge. This is our
                   least-recommended option because the conversion
                   will not embed the fonts and the resulting document
                   may not look good on other machines. </li>
            </ul>

</div></div> 

            <p>
            There are two primary ways to go from LaTeX to PDF.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Generate your dvi file from your LaTeX source.
                   Run dvips on the dvi file to produce a postscript file.
                   (dvips can be used to generate postscript from the dvi
                   file for direct output to a postscript printer or to a
                   file.) Then use a postscript utility such as ps2pdf to
                   convert the postscript file into pdf. The following
                   commands will produce a postscript file with type 3
                   fonts, which are more readable onscreen:
                   <br />
                   <br />

                   <blockquote>
                   dvips -Ppdf -G0 filename.dvi -o filename.ps
                   <br />
                   ps2pdf -dPDFsettings=/prepress filename.ps filename.pdf
                   <br />
                   </blockquote>

                   </li>

              <li> There are versions of pdfTeX and pdfLaTeX available for most
                   platforms. These systems do not generate dvi files from
                   your LaTeX source, but generate pdf directly. A standard
                   teTeX (Unix) installation of TeX has these available.
                   </li>
            </ul>
