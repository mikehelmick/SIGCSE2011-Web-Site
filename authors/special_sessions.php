<h2><a name="what">What Is A Special Session?</a></h2>
</div></div>          

 <p>
            Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and
            experiment with the SIGCSE conference format.
            Special sessions should <strong>NOT</strong> replicate
            existing SIGCSE session formats (i.e., panels,
            paper presentations, and poster sessions).
            They are 75 minutes in length and are scheduled in standard
            conference spaces.  Within these constraints, the form is yours
            to design.
            </p>

            <p>
            For example, a special session might be a tutorial or seminar,
            a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum,
            a rapid-fire sequence of five-minute talks, or a hands-on demo
            of dance moves proven to improve retention of CS material.
            </p>

            <p>
            Possible topic areas include management of large classes,
            projects and assignments, teaching computer science in K-12,
            experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM
            committee addressing issues at two-year colleges,
            or special issues arising when teaching computing outside
            of North America.
            </p>

            <p>
            Special session proposal review is not blind.  Criteria used
            in reviewing the proposals will include the likely level
            of interest in the session and the suitability and feasibility
            of the proposed format to its topic.  If the proposal
            is accepted, all presenters listed in the special session
            description will be required to register for the conference
            and to participate in the session.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: "risky" sessions (e.g., a "rapid-fire talks" session
            that has not yet secured committed presenters) should make
            a compelling argument for how the presenters will ensure
            the session's success.
            </p>

<h2><a name="format">How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?</a></h2>
</div></div>  

         <p>
            The proposal is limited to two (2) pages that conform to the
            <a href="/sigcse2011/authors/format.php">SIGCSE 2011 Format Instructions</a>
            with the following modifications and exceptions:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Do not include an abstract. Instead, the first section
                   should be titled <strong>Summary</strong> and should
                   provide a summary of the session.
                   </li>

              <li> Subsequent sections should contain the following information:
                   <ul>
                     <li> <strong>Overall objective of the session:</strong>
                          Describe the topic of the special session
                          and explain how the session will be organized
                          (e.g., as a committee report, tutorial,
                          hands-on exercise, ...).  Indicate why the
                          proposed session is important.
                          </li>

                     <li> <strong>Outline of the session:</strong>
                          Organize this section by subtopics, activities,
                          or a similar scheme.  If more than one participant
                          is involved, label each section of the outline
                          with the name of the participant who will be
                          presenting that section.  Note that in the
                          case of a committee report, the presenters might
                          be a subset of the authors.
                          <br />
                          We suggest that you allow at least 40 - 50%
                          of the time for questions and answers or
                          other interaction with the attendees.
                          All sessions are 75 minutes in length.
                          </li>

                     <li> <strong>Expectations:</strong>
                          State the intended audience. Indicate how much
                          the session will cover and what the audience should
                          learn.  This is particularly important if your
                          proposed special session is a tutorial.
                          If feedback from the audience is desired,
                          indicate how it will be elicited.  
                          </li>

                     <li> <strong>Suitability for a special session:</strong>
                          Include a brief description that justifies the
                          inclusion of this presentation as a special session.
                          Explain why the proposed presentation is better
                          suited for a special session than a paper or panel.
                          </li>
                   </ul>
                   </li>

              <li> References where appropriate are encouraged, but not
                   required.  If they are included, they should be placed
                   in a separate section titled <strong>References</strong>
                   and should follow the formatting guidelines.
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            If accepted, the special session description will be allocated
            two (2) pages in the conference proceedings and must adhere
            to the formatting guidelines specified above.  To facilitate
            the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
            critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting
            specifications and page limits.

            <ul>

              <li> All presenters must register for the conference.
                   </li>

              <li> Panel sessions are 75 minutes in length.  The session
                   must allow sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes)
                   for an interactive question and answer period involving
                   both the panelists and the audience.
                   </li>

              <li> Plan to attend the speakers' breakfast on the morning
                   of your presentation.  This will serve as a convenient
                   time for any final coordination of the presenters.
                   </li>

              <li> The conference supplies a projector but not a laptop.
                   You will need to bring a laptop or arrange to use one
                   from another attendee.  
                   </li>

              <li> Bring a backup copy of your presentation on a USB stick.
                   This will make it possible for all presenters on a panel
                   to make their presentations from a single laptop.
                   We especially encourage you to consolidate your
                   individual contributions into a single presentation.
                   This will result in smoother transitions from one speaker
                   to another.
                   </li>

              <li> Wireless Internet access should be available during
                   your presentation, but you should, of course, be aware
                   that there is always potential for failure.
                   </li>

              <li> Arrive at your room at least 10 minutes before the
                   panel session is scheduled to begin.
                   </li>
