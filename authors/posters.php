<h2><a name="what">What Is A Poster?</a></h2>
</div></div> 

 <p>
            Posters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation
            featuring "give and take" with conference attendees.  Presenting
            a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive
            feedback on a work in progress that has not been fully developed
            into a paper.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Posters should not be previously published or a previous poster</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Poster proposal review is <strong>not</strong> blind.
            </p>

            <p>
            Graduate or undergraduate students submitting posters may
            instead wish to submit to the 
            <a href="student_research.php">ACM Student Research Competition (SRC)</a>
            held at SIGCSE 2011.  Like normal posters, SRC posters are
            displayed at the conference, but the top poster authors
            also present their work and may win prizes and proceed
            to the international ACM Student Research Competition.
            </p>

<h2><a name="ideas">Poster Topic Ideas</a></h2>
</div></div>      

<p>
            The topic of a poster presentation is not limited.
            However, the topic should lend itself to presentation
            in poster format with additional details available in a handout
            or URL. You might consider a poster presentation
            of teaching materials that you would like to share
            or preliminary research findings, such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> imaginative assignments
                   </li>
              <li> innovative curriculum design
                   </li>
              <li> laboratory materials
                   </li>
              <li> effective ideas for recruiting and retaining students
                   </li>
              <li> computing education research that is in a preliminary stage
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Suggestions for poster design are given in
            <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/332132.332138"> Research Posters 101</a>.
            (Although these suggestions were published for student
            researchers, the ideas are also applicable to posters
            for this conference.)
            </p>

</div></div>      

<p>
            Poster presentations at SIGCSE will be competitive and
            if your proposal is accepted, your poster will be displayed
            for a 2-hour time period Friday during the conference.
            You will be expected to &quot;present&quot; your poster
            at that time.  At least one author for each accepted poster
            must register for and attend the conference.  The space
            available for your poster will be 4 feet high by 8 feet wide
            with a small shelf below. Power sources are not available.
            </p>

<h2><a name="format">How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?</a></h2>
</div></div>      

<p>
            Poster proposals consist of two documents:  The full poster
            proposal (submitted in PDF format) and a poster abstract
            (description) which must be entered into a text box on the
            submission page.  The full proposal is used for review and
            includes a copy of the poster abstract.  The format for the
            proposal should be as follows.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li> <strong> Poster Proposal Format (limited to 2 pages)
                            </strong>

                   <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                   Your proposal should include as much of the following
                   information as possible.  Please limit your proposal to
                   two (2) pages.  A list of the poster titles and authors
                   will be included in the conference proceedings
                   and the program.  Poster proposals are not published.
                   </p>

                   <ol>
                     <li> <strong>Proposer</strong>:
                          Include name, address, phone and fax numbers,
                          email address (expect most correspondence by email),
                          WWW address (if applicable), etc.  This item does
                          not count in the page limit. Poster proposals
                          do not undergo blind review, so this information
                          should be included.

                          </li>
                     <li> <strong>Significance and Relevance of the Topic</strong>:
                          Please include information about any trends
                          in relation to the topic and possibly describe
                          (or cite) evidence to that effect.  Your objective
                          here is to explain why the topic is significant.
                          This information can help your proposal to be
                          selected if resources become an issue.

                          </li>
                     <li> <strong>Abstract (Description)</strong>:
                          The abstract is a short (800 characters) description of
                          your poster.

                   The abstract is the description of the poster that will

                   The poster abstract must be submitted in plain text.
                   The abstract for an accepted proposal may contain a URL
