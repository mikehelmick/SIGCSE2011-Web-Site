<h2><a name="panel">What Is A Panel?</a></h2>
</div></div>          


            <p>
            Panel sessions provide an opportunity for expert panel members
            to present their views on a specific topic and then to discuss
            these views among themselves and with the audience.  Panel
            sessions run for 75 minutes.  Usually a panel session starts
            with a brief introduction of the panel topic and the
            participants, followed by short presentations by the 
            panelists giving their views. The session must allow sufficient 
            opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive question
            and answer period involving both the panelists and the audience.
            </p>

            <p>
            A typical panel will consist of four participants, including the 
            moderator.  Limiting a panel to 4 participants allows
            sufficient time for audience questions.  Proposals with more
            than four panelists <i>must convincingly show</i> that all
            panelists will be able to speak, and the audience able to
            respond, within the session time.
            </p>

            <p>
            Panel proposal review is not blind. Criteria used in reviewing the 
            proposals include the likely level of interest of the topic, the 
            presence of panel members with multiple perspectives on the topic, 
            and the likelihood that the panel will leave sufficient time for 
            audience participation.
            </p>

            <p>
            If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the panel
            description will be required to register for the conference and
            to participate in the session.
            </p>

<h2><a name="format">How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?</a></h2>
</div></div>     

            <p>
            The proposal is limited to two (2) pages that conform to the
            <a href="format.php">SIGCSE 2010 Format Instructions</a>
            with the following modifications and exceptions:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> When providing author information, indicate which
                   of the panelists is the moderator by placing the word
                   &quot;Moderator&quot; in parentheses after her/his name.
                   </li>

              <li> Do not include an abstract. Instead, the first section
                   should be titled <strong>Summary</strong> and should
                   provide a summary of the panel written by the moderator.
                   </li>

              <li> Subsequent sections should contain the position
                   statements of each panelist.  Title each section by
                   identifying the author.
                   </li>

              <li> References where appropriate are encouraged, but not
                   required.  If they are included, they should be placed
                   in a separate section titled <strong>References</strong>
                   and should follow the formatting guidelines.
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            If accepted, the panel description will be allocated two (2)
            pages in the conference proceedings and must adhere to the
            formatting guidelines specified above.  To facilitate
            the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy,
            it is critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting
            specifications and page limits.
            </p>

</div></div>     


 <p>
            Note that you will be required to submit your proposal
            electronically.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li> Write your proposal using the format specified above.
                   Within the proposal, you must provide Category and
                   Subject Descriptors, General Terms, and Keywords,
                   just as paper authors must do.  These requirements
                   are described in more detail in the
                   <a href="format.php">SIGCSE 2010 Format Instructions</a>.
                   </li>

              <li> Convert your proposal into Adobe PDF format.  Refer to our
                   <a href="creating_pdf.php">Creating Adobe PDF Documents</a>
                   page for assistance.
                   </li>

              <li> Submit the PDF version of your proposal using the
                   <a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~sigcse/sigcse2010/submission.shtml">online Submission Form</a>
                   Note that there are several
                   ways you must categorize your proposal submission in
                   the online system.  These categories are used to select
                   the reviewers who will evaluate your proposal.  Please
                   select no more than 3 categories to ensure the best
                   possible match with a reviewer of similar interests
                   and expertise.
                   </li>

              <li> Please do not wait until the last minute to submit
                   your documents because that is when everyone else
                   will be connecting to our server!
                   </li>

              <li> Make note of the proposal ID number and password
                   assigned to your submission. <strong>You will need them later.</strong>
                   You will receive an e-mail message confirmation.
                   Spam filters sometimes trap these
                   automatically generated messages so you may need
                   to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later,
                   acceptance or rejection notification.
                   </li>

              <li> After receiving confirmation, go to the 
                   <a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~sigcse/sigcse2010/submission.shtml">Author Verification Form</a>
                   to review your submission for accuracy.

            <ul>

              <li> All presenters must register for the conference.
                   </li>

              <li> Panel sessions are 75 minutes in length.  The session
                   must allow sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes)
                   for an interactive question and answer period involving
                   both the panelists and the audience.
                   </li>

              <li> Plan to attend the speakers' breakfast on the morning
                   of your presentation.  This will serve as a convenient
                   time for any final coordination of the presenters.
                   </li>

              <li> The conference supplies a projector but not a laptop.
                   You will need to bring a laptop or arrange to use one
                   from another attendee.  
                   </li>

              <li> Bring a backup copy of your presentation on a USB stick.
                   This will make it possible for all presenters on a panel
                   to make their presentations from a single laptop.
                   We especially encourage you to consolidate your
                   individual contributions into a single presentation.
                   This will result in smoother transitions from one speaker
                   to another.
                   </li>

              <li> Wireless Internet access should be available during
                   your presentation, but you should, of course, be aware
                   that there is always potential for failure.
                   </li>

              <li> Arrive at your room at least 10 minutes before the
                   panel session is scheduled to begin.
                   </li>
            </ul>
