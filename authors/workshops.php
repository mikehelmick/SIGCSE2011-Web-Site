            <p>
             Workshops provide an in-depth review of a topic of interest
             and should be immediately useful in the classroom.
             To this end, workshop presenters should provide participants
             with handouts outlining the workshop material.
             We plan to support a number of workshops involving
             <a href="#labs">hands-on computer use by participants</a>.
             All SIGCSE 2011 workshops will be half-day workshops (3 hours).
            </p>

            <p>
            Workshop Proposals undergo review but <strong>not</strong>
            blind review.  Proposals are evaluated for
            <strong>relevance, anticipated interest, quality,
            and availability of appropriate facilities</strong>.
            You may want to review the list of SIGCSE 2010 workshops 
            (<a href="http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2010/Program/viewAcceptedDayTime.asp?timeID=25264">1-14</a>,
            <a href="http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2010/Program/viewAcceptedDayTime.asp?timeID=45264">15-27</a>, and
            <a href="http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2010/Program/viewAcceptedDayTime.asp?timeID=53345">28-39</a>) prior to submitting a proposal.
            </p>

            <p>
            SIGCSE will reimburse presenters for handouts (up to $5 per
            participant) and will provide one night free lodging per
            workshop (not per presenter) at the conference hotel.
            </p>

</div></div>    


            <p>
            <strong>All</strong> hands-on workshops at SIGCSE 2011 will
            use participants' laptop computers at the conference site.  
            The Symposium Committee will help
            presenters distribute workshop software to participants
            prior to the Symposium, e.g., by providing attendee e-mail
            addresses for software distribution.  Distribution of software
            is the responsibility of the workshop leaders.  We recommend
            that the organizers of each hands-on workshop create their
            own web page (on their own server) with all necessary
            software and instructions for installation.  To accommodate late registrations, we will collect these URLs and make them available (for registrants only) at on-site registration.  We will also provide presenters with mailing lists containing the emails of current enrollees after early registration closes on the SIGCSE Web site.
            </p>

            <p>
            Proposers of hands-on workshops should indicate which of the
            following formats they wish for their workshop:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Laptop Required</strong>.
                   Participants should bring a laptop computer
                   to participate in this workshop.
                   </li>
              <li> <strong>Laptop Recommended</strong>.
                   It is recommended,
                   but not required, that participants bring a laptop
                   computer to this workshop.
                   </li>
              <li> <strong>Laptop Optional</strong>.
                   It is not necessary for participants to bring laptops
                   to this workshop.

<h2><a name="format">How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?</a></h2>
</div></div> 
        <p>
            Workshop proposals consist of <strong>two</strong> documents:
            the full workshop proposal and a workshop abstract.
            The full proposal is used for the review process only.
            The abstract is the description that appears in the
            Symposium program and proceedings.
            The format of these documents should be as follows.
            </p>

            <ol>

                   <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                   The first page is a title page that must contain
                   only the workshop title and presenters (items a and b
                   below).  The remaining information (items c through j
                   below) must fit on no more than two pages total
                   written in Times Roman, 12 pt. font.  The page format
                   is for 8 1/2 x 11 paper, 1 column, single spaced,
                   and 1 inch margins (top, bottom, left, right).
