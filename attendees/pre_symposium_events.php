<p>The Pre-Symposium Workshop for Department Chairs is an opportunity for all department chairs (experienced and inexperienced) to improve their understanding of their duties and their ability to perform them.  Participants should also include those interested in becoming department chairs.  Four experienced former department chairs will serve as resources for the group as the participants review and discuss the duties of the department chair and explore ways that chairs can do their jobs efficiently and effectively.  Some specific discussion topics will include leadership styles, time management, legal issues, academic program assessment, and faculty promotion and tenure.

<h2><a name="new_faculty">New Educators Roundtable</a></h2>
</div></div>
<img src="/sigcse2011/images/clock.png" align="absmiddle" />Wednesday, March 9, 2011, TBA

<p>New to teaching? Seeking advice and mentorship? Join us at the New Educators Roundtable (NER), a half-day workshop designed to mentor college and university faculty who are new to teaching. We welcome participants from across the entire teaching spectrum: tenure-track faculty at institutions where teaching is central, teaching-track faculty and lecturers, and graduate students who currently teach or are looking forward to an academic career. Come with your questions and concerns, learn from the experiences and best practices of sage elders, and build an international support group for your career. The roundtable will be held from (time to be determined) on Wednesday, March 9, 2010, immediately before the SIGCSE Symposium. Lunch will be provided.</p>

<h2><a name="sigcas">The 3rd Annual Humanitarian FOSS Symposium 2011</a></h2>
</div></div>
<img src="/sigcse2011/images/clock.png" align="absmiddle" />Wednesday, March 9, 2011, TBA

<p>The Third annual HFOSS Education Symposium (<a href="http://www.hfoss.org/hfoss2011">HFOSS 2011</a>), held as
a SIGCSE 2011 pre-conference activity (March 9th 2011, Dallas, Texas), aims to bring together educators,
software developers, industry representatives, and students to continue the discussion of how best to
promote HFOSS within undergraduate computing education. Humanitarian FOSS is free and open source
software that contributes in some way to the public good. This year’s symposium focuses on applying
HFOSS within the local community -- i.e., in local government, in K-12 education, and in collaboration
with local non-profit organizations. This years keynote speaker is Bryan Sivak, Chief Technology Officer
for the District of Columbia, founding member and advisory board member of Civic Commons. As in
previous years, the symposium will be highly interactive, taking place entirely in plenary sessions. In
addition to the keynote address by Bryan Sivak, the symposium will include a poster session, and panels
on government, K-12 education, and non-profits, made up of invited speakers and participants from
industry, academia, and the non-profit sector.</p>
