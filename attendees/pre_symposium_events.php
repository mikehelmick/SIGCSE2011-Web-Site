<h2><a name="hawaii">Hawaii â€“ Project companion for cloud-enabled mobile computing courses</a></h2>
</div></div>
<img src="/sigcse2011/images/clock.png" align="absmiddle" />Wednesday, March 9, 2011, 1:00pm - 5:00pm
<p>Microsoft Research's Project Hawaii is an academic outreach and research dissemination project.
The academic goal of Hawaii is to enable graduate and undergraduate university students to gain
understanding and expertise in developing cloud-enabled mobile applications using the Microsoft Mobile
and Cloud infrastructure. Project Hawaii is a collection of cloud services, hosted in Windows Azure;
a Visual Studio 2010 based development SDK and sample application code; a community forum for
exchange of ideas; and, mobile platform hardware (Windows Phone 7). Project Hawaii started in Spring
2010 when it was offered as a pilot project in USC, Duke and Wisconsin-Madison. In Fall 2010 Project
Hawaii was offered in MSU, CMU, Michigan, Maryland, Arkansas, UCSB and Singapore Management U.
Its third offering would be in Spring 2011 in more than 15 schools internationally. Prominent among the
Spring 2011 schools are Stanford, UCSB, Purdue, University College London; to name a few.</p>
<p>In this session Project Hawaii team will provide an overview of the project, with an emphasis on its use
as a project companion for teaching mobile and cloud computing courses. Instructors who have been
associated with Project Hawaii will be invited to talk about their experiences using Hawaii as a course
companion for teaching cloud-enabled mobile computing courses to graduate and undergraduate
computer science and engineering students. Demonstrations of projects by students using Hawaii will be
featured in the demo session.</p>

<h2><a name="innovativeApproaches">Innovative approaches to introducing Computer Science</a></h2>
</div></div>
<img src="/sigcse2011/images/clock.png" align="absmiddle" />Wednesday, March 9, 2011, 11:00am - 5:30pm
<p>This pre-conference workshop will bring together faculty to discuss
innovative approaches to introducing computer science using novel problem
domains. The innovation may be primarily through pedagogy. For example,
an instructor may use problem-based learning to build a course around
real, domain-specific problems and the techniques necessary to solve
them, rather than addressing a list of topics. Alternatively, a novel
approach may address a new context such as the modeling and analysis of
social networks. The workshop will address approaches that seek to change
the culture and practice of computer science by addressing the pipeline
at its early stages, specifically in introductory college courses in
computer science, mathematics, statistics, and the social and natural
sciences.</p>

<h2><a name="womenFaculty">Managing the Academic Career for Women Faculty in Undergraduate Computing Programs</a></h2>
</div></div>
<img src="/sigcse2011/images/clock.png" align="absmiddle" />Wednesday, March 9, 2011, 8:00am - 5:30pm
<p>Women in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) face particular challenges in pursuing and
maintaining academic careers at primarily undergraduate academic institutions. Women academicians
in CSE typically have few female colleagues to provide critical information about the culture and content
required for successful academic careers. To help this situation, the Computing Research Association
Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) will sponsor a career/mentoring
workshop titled "Managing the Academic Career for Women Faculty in Undergraduate Computing
Programs"". The day-long workshop, to be held on Wednesday, March 9, will be co-located with the
SIGCSE 2011 conference in Dallas. The goal of the workshop is to provide critical mentoring information
for women at all career levels in undergraduate teaching. The target audiences of the workshop are
pre-tenure faculty and graduate students in Computer Science and Engineering who are interested in an
academic career, as well as post-tenure (senior) faculty seeking to improve their teaching and mentoring
skills.</p>

<p>New to teaching? Seeking advice and mentorship? Join us at the New Educators Roundtable (NER), a half-day workshop designed to mentor college and university faculty who are new to teaching. We welcome participants from across the entire teaching spectrum: tenure-track faculty at institutions where teaching is central, teaching-track faculty and lecturers, and graduate students who currently teach or are looking forward to an academic career. Come with your questions and concerns, learn from the experiences and best practices of sage elders, and build an international support group for your career. The roundtable will be held from (time to be determined) on Wednesday, March 9, 2010, immediately before the SIGCSE Symposium. Lunch will be provided.</p>

<h2><a name="sigcas">The 3rd Annual Humanitarian FOSS Symposium 2011</a></h2>
</div></div>
<img src="/sigcse2011/images/clock.png" align="absmiddle" />Wednesday, March 9, 2011, TBA

<p>The Third annual HFOSS Education Symposium (<a href="http://www.hfoss.org/hfoss2011">HFOSS 2011</a>), held as a SIGCSE 2011 pre-conference activity (March 9th 2011, Dallas, Texas), aims to bring together educators,
software developers, industry representatives, and students to continue the discussion of how best to
promote HFOSS within undergraduate computing education. Humanitarian FOSS is free and open source
software that contributes in some way to the public good. This year's symposium focuses on applying
HFOSS within the local community -- i.e., in local government, in K-12 education, and in collaboration
with local non-profit organizations. This years keynote speaker is Bryan Sivak, Chief Technology Officer
for the District of Columbia, founding member and advisory board member of Civic Commons. As in
previous years, the symposium will be highly interactive, taking place entirely in plenary sessions. In
addition to the keynote address by Bryan Sivak, the symposium will include a poster session, and panels
on government, K-12 education, and non-profits, made up of invited speakers and participants from
industry, academia, and the non-profit sector.</p>
