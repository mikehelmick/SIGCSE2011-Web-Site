<strong>Intel Academic Community – Global MeeGo</strong><br/>
Speaker: Selwyn You - Intel Corporation, Jukka Heikkilä - University of Jyväskylä, Russel J Clark and Matthew Wolf - Georgia Institute of Technology<br/>
<em>Thursday, March 10: 1:45-3:00 PM</em><br/>&nbsp;<br/>
Have you heard the buzz about MeeGo? The newly formed MeeGo Operating System, a combination of Intel’s Moblin and Nokia’s Maemo, provides a unified development environment for developers with worldwide distribution channels to consumers. Learn how Intel’s Global MeeGo University program can help
	you integrate application development on netbooks, tablets,
	and smartphones into your curricula. Professors from the
	University of Jyväskylä and Georgia Institute of Technology will
	share insight into classroom modules that meet demand for rich
	application development on client devices. They will also share
	student feedback, in addition to how, why, and when you should
	start introducing MeeGo to your students.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study - Using the Intel Manycore Testing Lab to Test and Scale Applications</strong><br/>
Speaker Name: Bob Chesebrough, Innovative Software Education, Intel<br/>
<em>Friday March 11 - 1:45 pm- 3:00 pm</em><br/>&nbsp;<br/>
	Expand your students’ learning experiences with the Intel Manycore Testing Lab—a
	unique, global, remote-access facility made available at no charge to members of the
	Intel Academic Community. The Intel Manycore Testing lab can be used to test, validate,
	and improve the scalability of classroom labs, homework, and capstone projects. The
	lab supports both Linux* and MS Windows* with a 32-CPU/64-thread development
	environment, including up-to-date, essential performance tools to assist professors and
	their students.</p>
<p>
	Bob Chesebrough will demonstrate a command-line ray tracer application created by
	Master’s degree student Dave Frogley. The application was tested, scaled, and tuned
	on the Intel Manycore Testing Lab. Discussions will include scaling methodologies and
	state-of-the-art software tools. Bob Chesebrough is a senior course architect in Intel’s
	Innovative Software Education department.

<strong>F# - From Foundations to Modern Parallel and Data Rich Functional Programming</strong><br/>
Speakers: Don Syme (Microsoft Research, Cambridge) and Nigel Horspool tbc (University of Victoria)<br/>
<em>Thursday, March 10, 2011 - 10:45am to 12:00pm<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
F# is a multi-paradigm programming language, targeting the .NET/Mono platforms. F# brings you type safe, succinct, efficient and expressive functional programming language supporting both the imperative and object-oriented programming disciplines. It is a simple and pragmatic language, and has particular strengths in data-oriented programming, parallel I/O programming, parallel CPU programming, scripting and algorithmic development. F# combines the advantages of typed functional programming with a high-quality, well-supported modern runtime system and set of libraries. This tutorial will teach F# from several angles: 
<ul>
<li>F# as a cross platform language for teaching, including using F# on Windows, Macs, with Linux and MonoDevelop, and on the TryF# system</li>
<li>The advanced features of F#, including asynchronous and parallel programming and units of measure</li>
<li>F# type providers and their applications to strongly typed programming with web ontologies</li>
<li>F# as a modern data programming environment, including writing data-rich phone applications</li>
</ul>
Attendees should come away with a good idea of the utility and power of F# in the classroom context, and its use all the way up to postgraduate and research level.</p>

<strong>PexForFun – Programming Exercises and Automatic Grading in the Cloud</strong><br/>
Speakers: Peli de Halleux and Nikolai Tillmann, Microsoft Research, Redmond<br/>
<em>Friday, March 11, 2011 - 10:45am to 12:00pm</em><br/>&nbsp;<br/>
PexForFun can be used to learn software programming at many levels, from high school all the way through graduate courses. With PexForFun, the student edits the code in any browser and we execute it and analyze it for you in the cloud. PexForFun supports C#, VisualBasic and F#.  Because Pex4Fun has Intellisense, learning the syntax is not an obstacle for beginners. PexForFun finds interesting and unexpected input values that help students understand what their code is actually doing. Under the hood, PexForFun uses dynamic symbolic execution to thoroughly explore feasible execution paths. The real fun starts with Coding Duels where the student has to write code that implements a specification. PexForFun finds any discrepancies between the student’s code and the specification. PexForFun connects teachers, curriculum authors and students in a unique social experience, tracking and streaming progress updates in real time. Enough said, try it for yourself at <a href="http://pex4fun.com/">http://pex4fun.com/</a>  and come and hear about it at this tutorial, given by the authors of the system.

<strong>Can Students Really Develop Software Collaboratively?</strong><br/>Speaker: Brian Schimpf<br/>
&nbsp;</br/>
In the "real world" of software development, developers rarely work on a project alone.
Development has become a "team sport" with accepted rules, best practices, and preferred
tools. However, too often, students graduate only knowing how to develop code as an individual
– not as part of a team. With IBM's Rational Team Concert (free for classroom use from IBM's
Academic Initiative) students can work in a real-world team development scenario -- each with
different roles on the team. Work items can be sized and assigned to each team member,
and anyone can view real-time status and project health. Even better, professors can use the
dashboards and reports to view each student's contribution to the project to help them assess
each student individually.</p>
