<strong>Intel Academic Community – Global MeeGo</strong><br/>
Speaker: Selwyn You - Intel Corporation, Jukka Heikkilä - University of Jyväskylä, Russel J Clark and Matthew Wolf - Georgia Institute of Technology<br/>
<em>Thursday, March 10: 1:45-3:00 PM</em><br/>&nbsp;<br/>
Have you heard the buzz about MeeGo? The newly formed MeeGo Operating System, a combination of Intel’s Moblin and Nokia’s Maemo, provides a unified development environment for developers with worldwide distribution channels to consumers. Learn how Intel’s Global MeeGo University program can help
	you integrate application development on netbooks, tablets,
	and smartphones into your curricula. Professors from the
	University of Jyväskylä and Georgia Institute of Technology will
	share insight into classroom modules that meet demand for rich
	application development on client devices. They will also share
	student feedback, in addition to how, why, and when you should
	start introducing MeeGo to your students.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study - Using the Intel Manycore Testing Lab to Test and Scale Applications</strong><br/>
Speaker Name: Bob Chesebrough, Innovative Software Education, Intel<br/>
<em>Friday March 11 - 1:45 pm- 3:00 pm</em><br/>&nbsp;<br/>
	Expand your students’ learning experiences with the Intel Manycore Testing Lab—a
	unique, global, remote-access facility made available at no charge to members of the
	Intel Academic Community. The Intel Manycore Testing lab can be used to test, validate,
	and improve the scalability of classroom labs, homework, and capstone projects. The
	lab supports both Linux* and MS Windows* with a 32-CPU/64-thread development
	environment, including up-to-date, essential performance tools to assist professors and
	their students.</p>
<p>
	Bob Chesebrough will demonstrate a command-line ray tracer application created by
	Master’s degree student Dave Frogley. The application was tested, scaled, and tuned
	on the Intel Manycore Testing Lab. Discussions will include scaling methodologies and
	state-of-the-art software tools. Bob Chesebrough is a senior course architect in Intel’s
	Innovative Software Education department.

<strong>Can Students Really Develop Software Collaboratively?</strong><br/>Speaker: Brian Schimpf<br/>
&nbsp;</br/>
In the "real world" of software development, developers rarely work on a project alone.
Development has become a "team sport" with accepted rules, best practices, and preferred
tools. However, too often, students graduate only knowing how to develop code as an individual
– not as part of a team. With IBM's Rational Team Concert (free for classroom use from IBM's
Academic Initiative) students can work in a real-world team development scenario -- each with
different roles on the team. Work items can be sized and assigned to each team member,
and anyone can view real-time status and project health. Even better, professors can use the
dashboards and reports to view each student's contribution to the project to help them assess
each student individually.</p>
