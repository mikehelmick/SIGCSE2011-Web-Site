<p><strong>Can Students Really Develop Software Collaboratively?</strong><br/>Speaker: Brian Schimpf</p>
<p>In the "real world" of software development, developers rarely work on a project alone.
Development has become a "team sport" with accepted rules, best practices, and preferred
tools. However, too often, students graduate only knowing how to develop code as an individual
– not as part of a team. With IBM's Rational Team Concert (free for classroom use from IBM's
Academic Initiative) students can work in a real-world team development scenario -- each with
different roles on the team. Work items can be sized and assigned to each team member,
and anyone can view real-time status and project health. Even better, professors can use the
dashboards and reports to view each student's contribution to the project to help them assess
each student individually.</p>
