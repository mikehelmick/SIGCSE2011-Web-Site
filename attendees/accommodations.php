<h1>SIGCSE 2010 Accommodations</h1>

<p>To help conference attendees begin their travel planning, we are happy to provide the following information about the hotels which will have blocks of rooms available at special conference rates. And, as SIGCSE has done in the past, we have a roommate matching website to help pair you with a roommate to reduce the cost of attending the symposium.</p>
