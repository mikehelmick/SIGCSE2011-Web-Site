            NOTE:  U.S. Visa information is subject to change.  Please don't
            rely on this or any other unofficial web site for current
            U.S. government policies.
            </div>

            <p>
            The U.S. State Department Web Site, 
            <a href="http://travel.state.gov">travel.state.gov</a>,
            has information about obtaining a visa for those traveling
            to the United States.  This site has links to Web sites for
            U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide.  The embassy and
            consulate Web sites have very helpful information about
            procedures, timelines, communities served, required
            documentation, and fees.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you are traveling to the United States for tourism or
            business for 90 days or less, you may be eligible to visit
            the US without a visa.  For complete and updated information
            on requirements for this program, please see the US State
            Department's page on the 
            <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html">Visa Waiver Program</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Also be aware that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
            has recently enhanced its security requirements for
            international travelers who are citizens of countries covered
            by the Visa Waiver Program.
            Information about these requirements is available from the
            <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/" onclick="target='newwindow'">Electronic System for Travel Authorization</a>
            web site.
            In particular, travelers are expected to apply at least
            48 hours prior to departure.  We also understand that
            you should have your hotel's street address handy
            when you go through U.S. Customs.  You can find the addresses
            of the hotels on our accommodations (<i>coming soon</i>)
            web page.
