<h3>TeachScheme!</h3>

	In 1995, my research team and I decided to create TeachScheme!, an
	educational outreach project, with the hope that our work on programming
	languages could effect a dramatic change in K-12 computer science.
	Specifically, we envisioned a virtuous cycle of two mutually reinforcing
	ideas. On the one hand, we would create a design-oriented curriculum path
	from middle school through college. On the other hand, our approach would
	help kids with learning school mathematics. Hence a course on programming
	would benefit every student, not just those who end up choosing computer
	science as a college major. At this point, we have a new design-oriented
	curriculum; a pedagogic program development environment to make it fun;
	and a series of matching programming languages. After focusing at the
	overlap between high schools and colleges at first, we now use
	after-school programs to move upstream, and we are working on two major
	downstream courses for the second semester in college: one on
	object-oriented design and another on logic in program design.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
	
	My talk will focus on just one aspect of the project: the design-oriented
	curriculum and its smooth path from middle school to college.  I will
	first demonstrate how to teach an intellectually interesting and fun
	course on programming with something that looks like plain school
	mathematics. For the rest of the talk, I will sketch the path from there
	through college.</p>
	
<p><em>Bio:</em> 	Matthias Felleisen obtained his PhD ('87) from Daniel P. Friedman who also
	pointed him in the direction of a professorial career. He then spent the
	next 15 years at Rice University in Houston, including long and short
	sabbaticals at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh) and Ecole Normale
	Superieure (Paris). In 2001, he took on a position at Northeastern
	University in Boston and moved his entire team there. Felleisen and his
	distributed PLT team conduct research on all aspects of programming
	languages: design, implementations, and applications. On the side, they
	also run TeachScheme!, an educational outreach project.  Over his 25-year
	career, Felleisen co-authored six books. As a PhD student, he revised his
	adviser's "Little LISPer" (MIT Press), which is still in print in its 35th
	 year of existence. The two of them also wrote "A Little Java, A Few
	Patterns". With some of his own PhD students, Felleisen produced "How to
	Design Programs" (MITP, 2001) and "Semantics Engineering" (MITP, 2009).</p>

<h3>A Computer Scientist Goes to Washington:  How to be Effective in a World Where Facts are 10% of the Equation</h3>

<p><em>Friday, March 11, 2011, 8:30-10:00AM</em></p>

<p>Government's role in computer science is much larger than funding agencies.   Digital rights management, net neutrality and cybersecurity are hot topics in Washington, hot topics where regulation or legislation may have major impact on the computer systems we develop and enjoy.   Yet the rules governing DC are very different than the rules that govern science and engineering, and learning how to operate in a world where facts are only ten percent of the equation can be a challenging experience for someone more accustomed to proving theorems and building systems.   I'll describe what it takes for a nerd to be effective in the world of government, and give some specific examples in the hot area of cyberwar.</p>

Susan Landau's book "Surveillance or Security? The Risks Posed by New
Wiretapping Technologies" (MIT Press) will be appearing in spring
2011, and she will be spending 2010-2011 as a fellow at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study. From 1999-2010 Landau was a
Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, where she
worked on security, cryptography, and policy, including surveillance
and digital-rights management issues.  Landau is coauthor, with
Whitfield Diffie, of "Privacy on the Line: the Politics of
Wiretapping and Encryption"" (MIT Press, original edition: 1998;
rev. 2007), and author of numerous computer science and public policy
papers, as well as op-eds on cybersecurity and encryption policy.  She
is a member of the National Research Council Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board, serves on the advisory committee for the
National Science Foundation's Directorate for Computer and Information
Science and Engineering, and on the CSIS Commission on Cyber Security
for the 44th Presidency. She received her PhD from MIT, her MS from
Cornell, and her BA from Princeton.</p>

<h3>Three Human Computation Projects</h3>

<p><em>Saturday, March 12, 2011, 12:30-2:30PM</em></p>

At the height of its construction, 44,733 people worked on the Panama
Canal. The Great Pyramid of Giza required 50,000 workers and the
Apollo Project 400,000. No matter what you put on this list,
humanityâ€™s largest achievements have been accomplished with less than
a few hundred thousand workers because it has been impossible to
assemble (let alone pay!) more people to work together--until now.
With the Internet, we can coordinate the efforts of billions of
humans. If 400,000 people put a man on the moon, what can we do with
100 million? My research aims to develop theories and build computer
systems that enable massive collaborations between humans and
computers for the benefit of humanity. I am working to develop a new
area of computer science called human computation, which studies how
to harness the combined power of humans and computers to solve
problems that would be impossible for either to solve alone.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
In this talk I will discuss several examples of my work in human
computation, including reCAPTCHA, The ESP Game, and Duolingo.
I have used these projects in many of my courses to illustrate state
of the art concepts in computer science.</p>

<p><em>Bio:</em>	
	Professor Luis von Ahn works in the Computer Science Department at
	Carnegie Mellon University. He also works for Google after the
	acquisition of his company reCAPTCHA. His current research interests
	include encouraging people to do work for free, as well as catching
	and thwarting cheaters in online environments. He is the recipient of a
	MacArthur Fellowship, a Packard Fellowship, a Microsoft New Faculty
	Fellowship, and a Sloan Research Fellowship. He has been named one of
	the 50 Best Minds in Science by Discover Magazine, one of the 100 Most
	Creative People in Business of 2010 by Fast Company Magazine, one of
	the "Brilliant 10" scientists of 2006 by Popular Science Magazine, one
	of the 50 most influential people in technology by Silicon.com, and
	one of the Top Innovators in the Arts and Sciences by Smithsonian
	Magazine.</p>
