Pokens are the latest in electronic "social business cards", and we'll
have them available at SIGCSE 2011! If you have a poken and meet someone
else with a poken, simply hold the palms on the pokens together and you're
connected! You can configure them to share whatever information you'd
like... it's fully customizable so you can decide how much information you
want to share about yourself. You can connect to people you meet at SIGCSE
2011 on social networks without having to search for them, and so much
more.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
For SIGCSE 2011, all of our exhibitors will have pokens, so get one of
your own so you can connect easily with them as well as other attendees.
You can order a poken when you pre-register for SIGCSE 2011, at a special
discounted price of $15 per poken. (Styles will vary based on
availability.)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

The special discounted price of $15 per poken is available through
February 1, 2011 (the preregistration deadline).</p>
