         <p>
            The 
            <a href="http://www.acm.org/src/">ACM Student Research Competition</a>
            that will be held at the
            2011 SIGCSE conference will consist of two categories,
            graduate and undergraduate, with prizes awarded based on
            judging during the conference.  Research from all areas of
            computer science qualifies.  Students must be ACM student
            members in order to qualify for awards or travel grants.
            </p>

            <p>
            Judges will include professional computer scientists attending
            the conference activities.  Students' research will be evaluated
            on the quality and significance of the work, and the quality
            and clarity of both an oral and visual presentation.
            </p>

            <p>
            The first round of the competition evaluates the research during
            a poster presentation.  Those students who are selected by the
            judges to advance to the second round will continue in the
            competition by giving a formal, short, conference presentation
            of their research. The top three winners in the undergraduate
            and graduate categories as determined by the judges' evaluation
            of the conference presentations will receive the prizes of
            $500, $300, and $200, respectively.  These winners will advance
            to a final student research contest round where all ACM SIG
            conference contest winners are evaluated to determine one
            overall student research contest winner.  Only individual
            research may be submitted.
            </p>

            <p>
            No more than three research projects will be accepted from a
            single department and no more than two of those can be in a
            single category.  Departments are determined by the location
            of the research advisor.  Submissions for the research
            competition should describe the results of recently completed
            or ongoing computer science research conducted primarily by
            students. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Additional competition details, including information about
            past winners, can be found on the
            <a href="http://www.acm.org/src/">ACM Student Research Competition home page (http://www.acm.org/src/)</a>.

            <p>
            Research projects from all areas of computer science are
            acceptable.  The author submitting the abstract must still
            be a student at the time the abstract is due. Each submission
            should include the author's name, affiliation, postal address,
            and email address; research advisor's name; ACM student member
            number; category (undergraduate or graduate); research title;
            and an extended abstract (maximum 2 pages or 800 words)
            containing the following sections:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Problem and Motivation</strong>:
                   This section should clearly state the problem being
                   addressed and explain the reasons for seeking a solution
                   to this problem.
                   </li>
              <li> <strong>Background and Related Work</strong>:
                   This section should describe the specialized
                   (but pertinent) background necessary to appreciate the
                   work.  Include references to the literature where
                   appropriate, and briefly explain where your work departs
                   from that done by others.  Reference lists do not count
                   towards the limit on the length of the abstract.
                   </li>
              <li> <strong>Approach and Uniqueness</strong>:
                   This section should describe your approach in attacking
                   the problem and should clearly state how your approach
                   is novel.
                   </li>
              <li> <strong>Results and Contributions</strong>:
                   This section should clearly show how the results of your
                   work contribute to computer science and should explain
                   the significance of those results. 
                   </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Include a separate paragraph (maximum of 100 words) for
            publication in the conference proceedings that serves as a
            succinct description of the project. 
            </p>
