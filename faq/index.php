            <p>
            We are working hard to ensure that all of your questions can be
            answered by the area pages available from the main menu (above).
            We also know that some questions are just so common that
            a central collection of them, and their answers, can be a
            convenience.
            If you can't find your question's answer here, please try the
            area page(s) linked to the main menu.
            If even those pages don't help you,

              <li>  <em>Why was the submission deadline moved earlier this year?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    As the conference has grown, the review process
                    has become unmanageable in the short time allocated.
                    In addition, the authors are demanding better quality
                    in the reviews.  Change is necessary.  In response
                    to these pressures, Gary and Steve have implemented
                    a meta-reviewing process.  This added dimension
                    requires more time.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    A blog post on this question
                    ("<a href="http://sigcse2009.blogspot.com/2008/06/hey-where-did-my-week-go.html">Hey, Where Did My Week Go?</a>")
                    provides more information and an opportunity for comments.
                    </p>

                    -->

              <li>  <em>Which time zone is used for submissions deadlines?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    We consider deadlines to be at 23:59 (11:59 p.m.)
                    Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HST) on the indicated
                    dates.  HST is 10 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time
                    (that is, UTC -10).  For those of you in the US, that's
                    six hours behind Eastern Daylight Time, five behind
                    Central Daylight Time, and three behind Pacific Daylight
                    Time.  The effect is that almost everyone has several
                    'extra' hours to polish their submissions to a gleaming
                    shine.

              <li>  <em>What is the typical paper acceptance percentage?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    For both SIGCSE and ITiCSE the paper acceptance rate is
                    typically around 30%.
                    </p>

                    </li>

              <li>  <em>How many reviews does each paper receive?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    The Program Chair(s) and Committee ensure that every paper
                    receives a minimum of four reviews.
                    </p>

                    </li>

              <li>  <em>How are papers selected?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    The Program Chair(s) and Committee use the results
                    of the double blind reviewing process as a starting
                    point.  Typically, unless there are special
                    circumstances, the top rated papers provide
                    the majority of the program.  The rest of the program
                    is chosen from among the other highly reviewed papers
                    based on desired goals such as presenting a balanced
                    program, emphasizing particular topics, and encouraging
                    under-represented groups.  Particular attention
                    is given to evaluating the suitability of papers that
                    receive widely varying reviews or where a reviewer
                    indicates a low familiarity with the paper's topic area.

              <li>  <em>What is a double blind reviewing process?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    By &quot;double blind reviewing process&quot;,
                    we mean that reviewers do not know who submitted
                    the papers they review, and authors do not
                    know who reviewed their submissions.

qualified to review?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    Please contact the Program Chair(s) as soon as possible
                    to inform them of the problem.  The Program Chair(s)
                    may assign you an alternate paper.

                    Make a value judgment.  If you feel you can impartially
                    review the paper then go ahead and review it.  If you
                    feel uncomfortable reviewing the paper then contact
                    the Program Chair(s) as soon as possible.

                    </li>

              <li>  <em>What should I do if I notice plagiarism in a paper?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    SIGCSE will not accept papers that contain plagiarized
                    material.  Please contact the Program Chair(s) immediately.

              <li>  <em>Why is Photoshop trying to open my papers, and what can I do about it?</em>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.0em">
                    For security reasons, reviewers receive papers via a
                    URL that uses a <tt>.asp</tt> file extension.
                    This extension
                    is used for Active Server Pages, but also for Photoshop
                    photo indices.  If you have Photoshop installed, your web
                    browser or operating system may believe that Photoshop
                    is the appropriate application to access the file's content.
                    Here are two suggestions to deal with this problem:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                      <li> Save the <tt>.asp</tt> file with a <tt>.pdf</tt>
                           extension.  Outside of your browser, use
                           Adobe Reader (or another PDF file viewer) to
                           open the file.
                           </li>
                      <li> Modify your operating system's and/or web browser's
                           preferences to force it/them to open <tt>.asp</tt>
                           files with Reader.  When you are finished
                           retrieving your
                           assigned papers, you will probably want to return
                           the setting(s) to the original value(s).

                    Yes!  Conference registration is usually significantly less

                    time to contribute to the success of the conference,
                    we reimburse the conference registration fee.
